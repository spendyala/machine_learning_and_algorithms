    "1. Threads\n",
    "2. Processes\n",
    "3. Async programming\n",
    "\n",
    "### Threading lessons\n",
    "1. Threads are easy, threading is it's usual self\n",
    "2. Threads are OS threads and switch pre-emptively\n",
    "3. Python threads are limited to, effectively, a single core\n",
    "4.  &#9670; &#9670; Threads are a low-level concept.  Use higher level APIs if possible (e.g. concurrent.futures) \n",
    "5. When programming with threads, use concurrency patterns to help yourself out:\n",
    "    1. Access global state from ONE thread only\n",
    "    2. Communicate to that ONE thread from other threads using a Queue\n",
    "    3. To wait for thread(s), join() the thread or the Queue to signal no work is left\n",
    "    4. If you violate 1-3, use thread local variables if at all possible\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Process lessons\n",
    "1. Process api is an extension of Thread api\n",
    "2. Processes unlock multiple cores\n",
    "2. Gil doesn't interfere across processes\n",
    "3. Processes don't share mutable state\n",
    "4. &#9670; &#9670; Processes are relatively low-level concept.  Use higher level APIs if possible (e.g. concurrent.futures) \n",
    "5. You might still need some coordination primitives among processes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Threading and Process lessons\n",
    "Use concurrent.futures when you can\n",
    "\n",
    "### Async lessons\n",
    "1. There isn't any magic\n",
    "2. Can't use anything blocking\n",
    "3. Single threads can do a lot\n",
    "4. Proficiency requires personal study\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python packages we used\n",

    "import asyncio\n",
    "import concurrent.futures\n",
    "from threading import Thread\n",
    "from multiprocessing import Process\n",
