# Machine Learning Fundamentals - Understanding and Utilizing the Python Library Stack

This repository hold the notebooks, docker images, exercises, etc. for the Machine Learning Fundamentals series 
conducted by Proofpoint's Machine Learning/Data Science team. The intent is to provide a foundation for understanding
the tools, techniques and processees that will enable application of machine learning.

## Prerequisites

1) git - please [install](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and have a 
basic [working knowledge](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics) of git.
2) docker - please [install](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and have a 
basic [working knowledge](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) of docker.
3) python - you may want to have python 3 [installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/), although this isn't 
required. You will want at least an introdctory level of understanding programming in python. (There are numerous 
sources that will get you up to speed programming python. Try a google search and select the one you fancy.)
4) jupyter - should you elect to install python 3, you may also want to 
[install](http://jupyter.org/install) jupyter, although this is not required. We also recommend 
watching or reading through a tutorial to glean a basic understanding of Jupyter prior to participating in these 
sessions (again, google search...).

## Sessions

Each of the sessions will be hands on with the specific content for that session found in a sub-directory of this 
repository.

The session list follows:
